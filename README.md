## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

I've successfully joined the bootcamp. But before we can attend classes with tutors we had to get ourselves into the deep end and learn the basics of coding.
This project has been a great springboard to what's to come and I'm excited to learn more about front-end development
As my first project I've created a prework-study-guide following the instructions on the bootcamps website.
I learned how to set up my computer so it is compatible with curriculum. I learned how to use Git, create Github accounnt, associate SSH key with my account. (That was the hardest bit in this pre-course work)
